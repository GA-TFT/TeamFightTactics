# TF Meta
Our app displays the general information for Team Fight Tactics. Showing each unit currently in the set, their ability and traits. Other things that will also be shown are augment choices and information of all the traits.

# TF Meta Goals 
Team Fight Tactics is an auto battler game from Riot Games. We wanted to build an application for Team Fight Tactics to display current teamp comps, augments and traits. Making this application is really a good help if struggling which champions to use or which best augments and traits to go for while playing the game.
